In this project you are expected to design and implement a software for a hospital to manage patients. Your software must:
(i)allow one to add, remove patients and doctors or edit existing records,
(ii)provide a way to assign patients to doctors, and
(iii)provide a way to add short text notes to patients
You are expected to create a Java console application which persist its data between consequent runs.
Since the problem statement is rather brief, you are expected to explain your design choices, and simplifications to the problem in the form of code comments.
